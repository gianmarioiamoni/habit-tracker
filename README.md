### Advanced Security Solutions

The following solutions has been adopted inside the project to enhance data security: 

1. **Secure JWT Authentication**
   - **HTTP-Only Token**: Stored the JWT token in an HTTP-only cookie when issuing it during login. This prevents JavaScript access to the token, mitigating XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
   - **Token Expiry**: Set a short expiration time for the JWT (e.g., 1 hour) and implement a refresh token mechanism to maintain session security.
   - **Secure Signature**: Used a secure signature algorithm (HS256 or RS256) and keep secret key private and sufficiently complex.

2. **Data Validation**
   - **Input Sanitization**: Used `validator` library to ensure user inputs (e.g., email, name, password) are well-formatted and free from malicious code.
   - **Server-Side Validation**: Even with frontend validation in place, data are validated on the backend to prevent client-side manipulation.

3. **Protection Against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**
   - Implemented a CSRF token system in forms and APIs, especially for sensitive data-modification operations. When using cookies for authentication, a CSRF token is included for each POST/PUT/DELETE request.

4. **Sensitive Data Encryption**
   - Other sensitive data fields (e.g., email) are encrypted in the database.
   - Used AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm for encryption, decrypting data only when needed.

5. **Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection**
   - Limited failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks. Used `express-rate-limit` middleware to set login attempt thresholds.
   - Implemented CAPTCHA after a certain number of failed login attempts.
